# Blobun Mini Worldpak Converter

This is a program for converting Blobun Worldpak JSONs into a format that can be read by Blobun Mini. It was created to help us learn C#, so the code in here should not be copied directly without scrutiny.

Please see the repo for Blobun Mini for more information about this program and how it is used, as it is not useful on its own:
